# How far did life change during WW1 for the soldiers on the Western Front and civilians on the Home Front?
*by Isobel Pang*
## Introduction
World War One officially started when Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife were assassinated in Sarajevo, supposedly by Serbian nationalists. However, the creation of alliances and preexisting geopolitical tensions meant that the First World War built up over a long period of time, when most European countries had empires and world leaders were trying to expand their territory to be superior to their neighbours. The war was between the Triple Entente, made up of Britain, France and Russia, and the Triple Powers, made up of Germany, Italy, and Austria-Hungary. As the war progressed, more and more countries like America got involved in the war. In Britain. People in Britain were originally celebrating in the streets – they believed that the war would be over quickly and would result in a decisive victory for Britain. Patriotic young men flooded the recruitment offices and were shipped off to the front line, while their mothers, wives and daughters waited at home. In this case study I will look at how peoples’ lives and attitudes changed throughout the course of the war, and how the death of a duke shaped modern Britain.

## Life for Soldiers on the Western Front
### Recruitment
Because Britain was initially against conscription, the army was made up entirely of volunteers. This meant that Britain’s army was much smaller than other armies – it was the smallest when the war started in 1914. Lord Kitchener, the Secretary of State for War, realised that Britain needed a bigger army. They tried to appeal to Britain’s patriotic nature and peer pressure to encourage people to sign up. They also encouraged “pals battalions”, which was people from the same city, workplace or club signing up together in the same battalion. Although over a million men had signed up after conscription, propaganda and pals battalions, Britain still had a much smaller army than other countries which made it weaker against other countries like Germany and Austria-Hungary. Therefore, in 1916, Britain introduced conscription for the first time. By the end of the First World War almost 25% of the total male population of Britain had signed up, either forcibly or not – which was over five million people. Roughly half of all soldiers that joined up in Britain joined by conscription. Initially Britain relied on the patriotic spirit of volunteers, but as the war progressed and people began to lose loved ones and communities, Britain had to use force and conscription to send people to the front lines.

### Life in the Trenches
#### Food
Life in the trenches was dangerous, dirty and full of disease. At the start of the war, food was inadequate and monotonous, often consisting of famously hard dog biscuits that could crack teeth, tinned luncheon meat/bully beef, rum, and, or sometimes some bacon and tinned stew. Most soldiers did not get enough food to survive the intense effort of war, let alone a healthy varied diet. Low caloric intake, scurvy, night blindness and loss of muscle mass were some of the most common health issues. (Despite this, deaths from malnutrition were very low.) Drinking water had to be purified with chemicals, so soldiers would mask the taste with tea, coffee or rum when they could get some. In extreme conditions, some soldiers would boil muddy water from trench puddles. As the war progressed, supply improved and field kitchens were created to provide soldiers with bread, vegetables and fresh meat. Sugary snacks like cakes, sweets and pies were given to soldiers to boost their energy levels and keep up morale. Even at the end of the war, food shortages were common and supplying food for both large armies and the population of Britain on the home front was difficult for governments and military planners, especially when the Germans began bombing food transports with U-Boats. Overall, scientists made many discoveries in food science and nutritional deficiencies in WW1, and so the diet of soldiers gradually improved and progressed over the war.

#### Hygiene
In the muddy, damp trenches it was also hard to keep hygienic. During the winter months, many viruses and bacteria plagued the soldiers, so soldiers were given “gelatine lamels” that dissolved in water or on the tongue to cure most common colds and illnesses. However, lice were a common problem that caused a variety of symptoms from general itchiness and discomfort to “trench fever” (bacterial infection causing fever, weakness, dizziness, headache and sore legs) and typhus. Soldiers would try and combat the lice by chatting (crushing lice with fingers), taking baths, washing clothes, disinfecting bedding, using louse-repellent gel or running a lit match along infected clothing. A new term, “trench foot”, was created after soldiers’ tight boots in waterlogged trenches caused swelling and decay. If left untreated, it often resulted in amputation, as this was the only available solution at the time. Amputated limbs often had poorly fitted prosthetics and in the dirty trenches the wounds could often get infected, as well as the emotional impact of losing a limb.
## Life for People on the Home Front
### Women
On the Home Front, women, citizens in Britain and even some conscientious objectors were doing their part in the war. (The Home Front refers to the civilian population and activities of a nation whose forces are engaged in war abroad.) When war struck, Britain only had 60 days’ worth of food left in its reserves – Scotland only had 3 days’ worth of food. The government knew food security would be a problem in this war, that only got worse when the German U-Boats started bombing food shipments from America. Because most young men had gone off to fight, industries suddenly lost the workforce they needed to produce munitions or prepare for war. To replace this gap in workers, factories, farms and hospitals turned to women to fill the void. Women were expected to “do their bit”. They were paid less than men and worked longer hours, but this was one of the first steps towards equal rights and job opportunities for women. Many women saw this not only as defending their country, but also as a step towards recognition and equality, especially for Suffragettes. One observer wrote that American women “do anything they were given to do; that their hours are long; that their task is hard; that for them there is small hope of medals and citations and glittering homecoming parades.” These female workers were often discriminated against despite proving that they were as good as men and after the war most of them lost their jobs. Although WW1 was a vital step towards equality for women, after the war ended very little had changed for most women.
### Total War
Even those that didn’t fight suffered the effects of the First World War. World War One was called a "total war" because the scale and devastation of the war meant that it was hard to separate the roles of soldiers and civilians at home. When the government introduced the Defence Of the Realm Act (DORA), people initially accepted the changes as necessary, however, as the war went on people began to see the laws as restrictive to their freedom. They ranged from trivial, like a ban on whistling, to draconian, like the censorship of the press, letters from soldiers on the front line, and any public criticism of the war. During the war, everyone was expected to "do their bit" for the war effort. Propaganda was also common, used in posters, newspapers and radio broadcasts. It was used to justify the war and present a favourable image of the war, and to dehumanise the enemy, and even "enemy aliens" - foreign nationals in a country at war with their homeland. Propaganda was also used with censorship to keep the citizens of Britain under control and happy. The government also used propaganda to encourage people to assist the war effort, for example, to encourage women to join munitions factories or to join the army. As the war went on more laws, like DORA, were introduced, and propaganda was increased.

### Conscientious Objectors
Some people didn't want to go to the front lines, for moral or religious reasons or because they didn't want to die. These people were known as conscientious objectors, sometimes labelled as "conchies" or "pansies", and were often looked down on by their neighbours, who gave them white feathers to show their cowardice. Public opinion towards conscientious objectors (conscientious objectors) during World War I was initially quite hostile. Propaganda presented them as cowards or traitors. They were depicted very negatively in posters and cartoons. Later, as more and more casualties came in from the front line, attitudes towards conscientious objectors began to soften somewhat. When conscription was introduced, conscientious objectors were given the option to appeal to avoid conscription on moral grounds. Some were offered exemption if they agreed to help the military in other ways, like driving ambulances. Despite this, many conscientious objectors still faced harsh treatment, including imprisonment and hard labour. Conscientious objectors who refused to take any part in the war including civilian service were imprisoned, fined heavily and sent to hard labour camps. Some religions, like Jehovah's Witnesses, Quakers, and Mennonites refused to get involved with the war at all, preferring pacifism. They were ostracised and socially excluded for their beliefs. Overall, the attitudes to conscientious objectors eventually weakened, but they were still strongly hated by the general public.

_Transcript:_

_Dear Mr Hunt,_

_Thanks very much for your letter which I received a week or two ago, also for the magazine._

_We are in the trenches just now. In fact we seem to spend about three times as much time in as we do out. Also we are in a pretty warm spot, it was about here, towards the end of last summer that the French and German had some of the fiercest fighting of the war. The country around about is a veritable maze of trenches. The fighting at one time was so fierce that there was only time just to bury the dead in the sides of the trenches, and now that the trenches have crumpled one is constantly seeing the bones of men’s legs or their boots, or skulls sticking out from the sides of the trenches, pleasant, eh? There will be a pleasant smell here in the summer. I only hope we are not here then. In places we are only about twenty yards away from Fritz and company. Consequently all times the air is pretty thick with bombs, grenades and trench mortars. These last are pretty hellish sort of toys. They have an explosion like about ten earthquakes rolled into one. But even these are not the worst we have to put up with. The trenches being so close together there is of course any amount of mining going on. So one never knows when the particular lump of earth one is standing on is going to take a trip through the solar regions. When a mine does go up, there is some excitement knocking about I can tell you. Suppose for instance we were going to explode one, all the artillery in the neighbourhood is ranged on the spot and directly the mine is exploded, there is hell let loose on the crater. Of course as soon as he gets the range the enemy replies, so that the air is fairly full of everything that kills quickly. One can on these occasions always rely on a good many casualties. Since we have been in this spasm there have been five exploded in this neighbourhood, while others are expected to go up at any time. So much for conditions here._

_How is everything in town? Pretty quiet I suppose. I see you’ve had the zepps (Zeppelins) over again? Is it a fact that one dropped in the Thames? **(Lines censored.)** That is about all the news, so will close, kindest regards to everybody. Yours very sincerely,_

_Gilbert Williams._

This source is a letter from a soldier in April 1916. This source would be useful to a historian studying life in World War One because it tells them about the weapons used in WW1. The soldier mentions different explosive devices used in warfare, including trench mortars, which was a new invention created in 1915. This could tell a historian how new technological developments were used in battle and how the soldiers experienced the war from the front lines. The source also briefly tells us about the kind of things soldiers were sent as gifts from home, in this case, a magazine. The source is also useful because it tells historians about how soldiers fought battles. The area between enemy trenches, called no-man’s-land, was often the site of most of the fighting and explosions. Soldiers would be asked to go over the trenches and charge through no-man’s-land to enemy trenches. This source tells us how exactly the fighting started, by firing artillery at a single spot at once, and firing rounds back and forth for a while. It also tells us what soldiers thought of the trenches and the fighting. This soldier doesn’t fear or dislike war at all from his letter, however most soldiers had to deal with physical injuries and mental injuries like PTSD or “shell shock” after they returned home. The source offers a unique perspective on the struggles of war. This source is also useful because it shows historians more gruesome sides of the war that censors and propaganda would try and hide. Often censors would try and block information discouraging soldiers from signing up. This soldier says that in the middle of intense fighting casualties were buried in the walls of the trenches. This information would not be found in any government propaganda or mainstream sources, making this source more useful to a historian.

This source has limits to a historian studying life in World War One because some of the end of the letter is censored. Although this shows us how letters were censored, any more information provided by the soldier is lost now. This soldier also seems to be quite unconcerned about the death and violence of war, however, most soldiers would be fighting in terrible conditions and would have been horrified by the death around them and the horrors of war they had seen. This soldier’s opinion is entirely subjective and does not represent a balanced view of events. This source also has limits to its usefulness because only the parts that make the war seem good have been left in. This source, while useful, only tells us about how the censors want to make the war seem. The source also has limits to its usefulness because this source only tells us about the local experiences of a soldier. This source cannot tell us about the effects of the war across the whole front line, or the experience of fighting in other countries except France around the world. This source is also not useful because no dates or details are given. We know this letter was sent in April 1916, however, understanding the whole letter requires an understanding of the context of the time. For example, he mentions a zeppelin that fell in the Thames, but it requires knowledge of current events in London to fully understand. This limits the letter’s usefulness to those who do not have additional context.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, almost every part of British life changed during World War One.
### The Western Front
Medical advances in dietary health and trauma treatment led to improved quality of life on the front lines. More field hospitals were created and new medicines and surgical techniques were discovered to keep up with growing injuries from new weapons. Soldiers were given better food, clothing and equipment. Troop morale was made a priority, with sweets, gifts from home and occasional leave eventually being given to the soldiers. This made the lives of soldiers better and longer, as they didn’t have to fight in uncomfortable, dirty conditions for long periods of time. Although this was very good for soldiers, Soldiers were also trained better to prepare them for war and increase their chances of survival. This meant less casualties and more effectiveness at the front line.

However, some aspects of the war became worse as the war went on. Trenches became deeper, less hygienic, and more dangerous. Conscription was introduced, which forced many men to either fight in an increasingly dangerous war or be sent to prison and shamed as a conscientious objector. Although this increased the size of the army, which could be seen as progress for the government because it helped to turn the tide of the war, it was regress for the families who didn’t want to enter the war. Even though medicine improved, as weapons were developed injuries became more common and more fatal. As the war continued, more soldiers died or returned with psychological injuries, and many families back in Britain began grieving. This meant that more information coming back from the war was censored, propaganda increased, and families bereaving were ignored.

Some aspects of life did not change at all for soldiers. Life in the trenches was dirty, exhausting and unpleasant throughout the war. Although efforts were made to improve the experiences of soldiers in the war, there were still many casualties at the end of the war. Food supplies were often limited and unstable, and disease and injuries were very common. Even though cleanliness was encouraged, this was hard in the muddy trenches, and dysentery, influenza and trench foot were still common by the end of the war. Many of these cases were prevented with more frequent bathing, leave, and cleaner conditions, but this did nothing for other soldiers with less access to these resources.
### The Home Front
The lives of civilians changed as well. The absence of working men created greater demand for women in the workforce. Although this was in important step in equal rights for women, women were still paid less, treated less fairly than men, and lost their jobs after the war ended. Although this was progress to some women, for others nothing changed after the war. The technological advances made during the war also helped civilians. Gas masks were invented (although these only had to be invented because mustard gas was invented). Motor vehicles like cars and vans were developed and refined for carrying supplies and people. This generally improved the lives of most civilians. The wartime economy also created new job opportunities in certain sectors, such as making munitions and farming land. However, once the war ended and survivors went home, it had the opposite effect of a shortage of jobs for most people. 

However, most citizens also suffered during the First World War. When the Germans bombed food supplies with U-Boats, there was a serious food shortage in Britain. Civilians were encouraged to grow their own food, and rationing was introduced to stretch out food supply. This caused a limited variety of foods and nutrients, a rise in black market goods being sold, and an increased cost of living despite an equal distribution of food. All of these effects were very negative for stressed households. The pain of losing loved ones in battle, or waiting without news, was also very negative for families. "Enemy aliens", such as German or Belgian refugees, were placed in detainment camps in poor conditions and separated from their families.

#### Final Thoughts
World War One was the first war that affected everyone fighting on the front lines, and at the Home Front. Although medicine, weaponry and politics changed during WW1, the most important thing that changed was the people. Roughly two million people were employed for the first time as a step towards gender equality, but nine to eleven million people lost their lives in battle. A further six to thirteen million civilians died from disease. Some people were celebrated as heroes when they returned home and others were alienated from their communities. Many were jobless when they returned, and many more never returned. Although a few people had positive experiences of war, many more had very negative experiences. But they should all be remembered.
